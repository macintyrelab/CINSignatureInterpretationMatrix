## Procedure to create the signature interpretation matrix

This repository contains the procedure to create the signature interpretation matrix for copy number signatures (Drews et al., 2022)
The three input matrices (sum-of-posterior, signature definitions and signature activities) are included in the data folder. These matrices are derived from ~6000 tumor samples of 33 tumor types as part of the pan-cancer study. The central hub for the study can be found in https://github.com/markowetzlab/Drews2022_CIN_Compendium

## Ongoing research
Our procedure to establish a method to link the signature definitions with the signature activities in order to improve the biological interpretation of signatures is subject of ongoing research. We are working on extend this procedure to other types of mutational signatures. This will be published in a paper in its own right.
